Steampipe plugin for [RSpace ELN](https://www.researchspace.com).

[Justification.md](./docs/Justification.md) describes the motivation for this plugin and a brief introduction to ELNs in research data management.

This plugin provides some access to RSpace resources via the activity/ and documents/ API using  [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io). It supports a prototype dashboard that can show various metrics about RSpace activity. It also supports the notions of 'controls' that can
provided alerts or warnings about good practices.

[Docker.md](./docs/Docker.md) explains how to run an RSpace dashboard out-of-the-box without having to install or configure Steampipe.

Please suggest any information you'd like to see in the dashboard.
